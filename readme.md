## Welcome to moodring
Moodring is an Appirio accelerator app built as a native IOS app in Swift with two main goals.
  1. Give users a quick easy way to log their fun factor on a daily basis
  2. Provide a simple conduit to 360 degree feedback.

This app will have a client (Swift) component as well as a server side (Heroku) component.

## Client
The client is built in Swift and will be created as a series of [Topcoder](topcoder.com) challenges for the Swiftober initiative.

## Server    
The server (API) will be written in NodeJS and will be built as a series of Adaptors to various Cloud providers.   The first two adaptors will support Salesforce and Slack respectively.
